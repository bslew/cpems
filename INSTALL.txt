To install this package you will also need to compile some external packages
that are not provided in the standard linux repositories.

To install follow the steps below. Assuming that the sources are located in 
cpems subdirectory

1) create build directory: eg.
mkdir cpems-build
cd cpems-build

2) cmake ../cpems

3) compile external packages
make external

4) compile cpems libraries
make

5) install cpems libraries
make install


Currently the package still requires gsl-1.8 which uses old interface.
The package is provided but since it has it's own biuld we leave it to 
the user to build and install it in some visible directories.
