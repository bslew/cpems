The planetary ephemeris DE424 was created primarily to support the 
NASA Mars Science Laboratory navigation team during early cruise.

While DE424 suitable for most other purposes, 
the planetary ephemeris DE421 is recommended for general use, 
and specifically for lunar laser ranging data analysis and lunar space missions.
