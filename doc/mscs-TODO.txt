0) things to do while programing

- think about reading cmbfast power spectra - the procedure for
  setting initial conditions .C_l..parameters can only read one format
the problem is with cmbfast 4 column format or 2 column my format so
the program will be unable to read in cmbfast power spectra properly
**** solution: done in loadsave manager. parameters are set there for
  loading. 

- develop the naming in the program especially eg. for the C_th and C_l 
should contain the informaiton about the ranges of calculated C_th and C_l respectively.
eg. wmap-64-C_th-0-180-txt or wmap-64-C_l-0-550-txt
but the quiestion is then - how to read them - more parameters should be passed to the load 
methods

- add ability to force loading and saving given filename. 


- the gsl random numbers don;t work as they should - FIX IT !!!!

1) things to check at testing level:

- think what goes to the constructor and what goes to destructor im	map class
- check the file i/o functions if they return the right file sizes and if 
they set the object variables correctly.
