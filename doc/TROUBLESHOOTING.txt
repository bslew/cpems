TROUBLESHOOTING

* If after an errorless compilation and linking of the programs you encounter an error
  like:
	./bin/cosmocalc: symbol lookup error: ./bin/cosmocalc: undefined symbol: _ZN9QListData7detach3Ev
  this means that you are loading libQtCore shared library different than
  the one with which the package was compiled and you should setup correctly
  the LD_RUN_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables so that the correct shared
  library was loaded at the run time.

* CPEDS/src/cpeds-fits.cpp:112: error: invalid conversion from ‘const char*’ to ‘char*’
use a newer version of fits > 3.200 is a good bet
