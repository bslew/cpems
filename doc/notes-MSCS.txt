MAP SIMULATION:

is seems that the simulation of the map in fourier space can be performad basically in two ways.
1) one can simulate a_lm's according to the underlying power spectrum C_l by
alm = x * sqrt(C_l) where x is a complex number of which the real and imaginary parts are driveng from the gaussian distribution.
with zero mean and unit variance.
In this approach the resulting simulated power spectrum will of course yield  the chi squared distribution (because of the definition of the power spectrum) 
but the scatter - the
uncertainty in generated C_l will be proportional to the sqrt(C_l). In a result the simulated spectrum will not follow the cosmic variance uncertainties
and will not show it that way. The latter should be bigger at large scales where the number of degrees of freedom for sky realizations of individual  modes
is much smaller than at small scales  - large l's.
This constitues a problem which I in my oppinion was also ommited by authors of the GLESP paper.

2) It is also possible to manitulate with the variance of the gaussian distribution with which the random numbers are generated for each C_l.
In this approach the schape of the power spectrum also depends on the underlying C_l since if one uses for x number generation the distribution
N(0,C_l) then the bigger C_l the bigger wider the gauss distribution function will become and the bigger probability that the generated number will 
be farther from 0 as if compared with the case when C_l is small. When C_l is small then the Gauss distribution is very narrow and the gaussian numbers
driven from this distribtion will more compactly be packed around 0. This results that statistically from low C_l values smaller numbers are multipilied
by the sqrt(C_l) and for bigger C_l's bigger numbers are multiplied by sqrt(C_l). However this recipe fails.
It seems that in this case it would be enough to use formula:
alm = N(0,SQRT(C_l));


3) as compared with the simulations of the Healpix package see notes from test2-notes in /home/blew/programy/healpix/Healpix-1.2-stary/bin.
In short the results are similar - the scatter does not gets significantly smaller from l 0 to 200. Aterwards it gets smaller
but this is rather the result of the small power in the multipole - the the inftrinsic variance of from the RNG is multiplied by smaller
number. and the 'grass' is lower. The similar effect can also be seen before the first acoustic peak.
